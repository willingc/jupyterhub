# Quickstart - Installation

## Prerequisites

**Before installing JupyterHub**, you will need:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.3 or greater

  An understanding of using [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) or
  [`conda`](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/get-started.html) for
  installing Python packages is helpful.

- [nodejs/npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

  [Install nodejs/npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node),
  using your operating system's package manager. For example, install on Linux
  (Debian/Ubuntu) using:

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install npm nodejs-legacy
  ```
  
  (The `nodejs-legacy` package installs the `node` executable and is currently
  required for npm to work on Debian/Ubuntu.)

- TLS certificate and key for HTTPS communication

- Domain name

**Before running the single-user notebook servers** (which may be on the same
system as the Hub or not):

- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
  version 4 or greater

## Installation

JupyterHub can be installed with `pip` or `conda` and the proxy with `npm`:

**pip, npm:**
```bash
python3 -m pip install jupyterhub
npm install -g configurable-http-proxy
```

**conda** (one command installs jupyterhub and proxy):
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterhub
```

To test your installation:

```bash
jupyterhub -h
configurable-http-proxy -h
```

If you plan to run notebook servers locally, you will need also to install
Jupyter notebook:

**pip:**
```bash
python3 -m pip install notebook
```

**conda:**
```bash
conda install notebook
```

## Start the Hub server

To start the Hub server, run the command:

```bash
jupyterhub
```

Visit `https://localhost:8000` in your browser, and sign in with your unix
credentials.

To allow multiple users to sign into the Hub server, you must start `jupyterhub` as a *privileged user*, such as root:

```bash
sudo jupyterhub
```

The [wiki](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/wiki/Using-sudo-to-run-JupyterHub-without-root-privileges)
describes how to run the server as a *less privileged user*, which requires
additional configuration of the system.

## Basic Configuration

The [getting started document](docs/source/getting-started.md) contains
detailed information about configuring a JupyterHub deployment.

The JupyterHub **tutorial** provides a video and documentation that
explains the fundamental steps for installation and configuration.
[Repo](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub-tutorial)
| [Tutorial documentation](http://jupyterhub-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

### Generate a default configuration file

To generate a default configuration file, `jupyterhub_config.py` in
the current directory:

```bash
jupyterhub --generate-config
```

### Customize the configuration, authentication, and process spawning

Settings can be configured in the `jupyterhub_config.py` file or via
command line options when running `jupyterhub`.

For example, the following command, by passing options, will spawn a
server on `10.0.1.2:443` with **https/SSL**:

```bash
jupyterhub --ip 10.0.1.2 --port 443 --ssl-key my_ssl.key --ssl-cert my_ssl.cert
```

The authentication and spawning mechanisms for single-user notebook
servers can be replaced, which allows plugging into a variety of
authentication and process control environments. Some examples are:

- Using GitHub OAuth instead of PAM with [OAuthenticator](https://github.com/jupyterhub/oauthenticator)
- Spawning single-user servers with Docker, using the [DockerSpawner](https://github.com/jupyterhub/dockerspawner)

----

## Alternative Installation using Docker

A ready to go [docker image for JupyterHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/)
offers a straightforward deployment of JupyterHub.

*Note: This `jupyterhub/jupyterhub` docker image is only an image for running
the Hub itself. It does not provide the other Jupyter components, such
as Notebook installation, which are needed by the single-user servers.
To run the single-user servers, which may be on the same system as the Hub or
not, Jupyter Notebook version 4 or greater must be installed.*

### Starting JupyterHub with docker

The JupyterHub docker image can be started with the following command:

```bash
docker run -d --name jupyterhub jupyterhub/jupyterhub jupyterhub
```

This command creates a container named `jupyterhub` that you can
**stop and resume** with `docker stop/start`.

The Hub service will be listening on all interfaces at port 8000, which makes
this a good choice for **testing JupyterHub on your desktop or laptop**.

If you want to run docker on a computer that has a public IP then you
should (as in MUST) **secure it with ssl** by adding ssl options to your
docker configuration or using a ssl enabled proxy, such as nginx with
SSL termination.

The command `docker exec -it jupyterhub bash` will spawn a root shell in your
docker container. You can **use the root shell to create system users in the container**.
These accounts will be used for authentication in JupyterHub's default
configuration.
